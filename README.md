# UDACITY Projects


## Motivation

I am officially taking Udacity **Data Scientists** *nano-degree* and I decided to summarize the projects that I am doing here. Projects 1,2 and 3 are part of the **Machine Learning Engineering** Nano degree that I did not take the course and only did the projects.

## Usage example

These projects cover almost all aspects of Machine learning other than Reinforcement learning,

## Requirements

The major libraries used in these projects are:
1. numpy,
2. pandas,
3. scickitlearn
4. Keras
5. Pytorch


## File structure

1- boston_housing : A **regression** example
2- dog_app_Keras: An image classifier example using **Keras**
3- finding_donors: clustering and classification example by using **scikitlearn** library
4- finding_donors2: more sofisticated clustering example by using **scikitlearn** library
5-1-Image Classifier Project_PyTorch: An image classifier example using **PyTorch**
5-2-3-4- Solves exact same problem in 5-1 utilizing **argpars** in command prompt
